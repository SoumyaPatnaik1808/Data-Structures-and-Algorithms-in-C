# Data Structures & Algorithms Journey

Welcome to my DSA repository! This project serves as a comprehensive documentation of my progress as I master fundamental and advanced computer science concepts.

##  The Mission

The goal of this repository is to build a rock-solid foundation in problem-solving. While the curriculum I am following delivers logic and examples in **C++**, I have made the conscious decision to implement every solution in **C**.

###  Why the C Translation?

Taking a concept explained in C++ and rewriting it in C provides two major advantages:

1.  **Academic Synergy:** My current college coursework is centered around the C programming language. This project allows me to stay ahead in my academics while exploring complex data structures.
2.  **Logic over Syntax:** By switching languages, I have eliminated the possibility of "copy-pasting." To make the code work, I must deeply understand the underlying logic, memory management, and pointer manipulation, then manually transform those ideas into functional C code.

##  Repository Structure

Each directory represents a specific module or data structure. Inside, you will find:
* **Implementation:** Clean, documented `.c` files.
* **Notes:** Brief explanations of the logic used and any challenges faced during the translation from C++.
* **Complexity:** Analysis of Time and Space complexity ($O(n)$) for the algorithms.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **Primary Language:** C
* **Logic Source:** C++ Curriculum
* **Environment:** GCC Compiler / Linux / VS Code
